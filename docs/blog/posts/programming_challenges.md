# Programming Challenges
Sometimes my practical nature is easily bored by the abstract tasks in LeetCode,
HackerRank, and other similar platforms. I've found these challenges to be very
entertaining and practical.

I am going to keep a list of them here and update it in case I find more. This will also
be a good way to keep track of my progress (and a reminder of unfinished tasks :).

## Coding Challenges
Link: [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/)

Description: A collection of "Build your own X" challenges with a limited scope of X.
For example, build your own wc, cat, grep, etc. The scope is also set with step-by-step
approach, so you can develop your solution incrementally. Great way to finally answer
"What project should I build to learn this $language?".
