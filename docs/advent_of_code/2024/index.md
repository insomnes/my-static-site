# Advent of Code 2024
In this year we are looking for lost Chief Historian elf through all important
events and places of The Advent of Code history.

And I've decided to refresh my Go skills by solving AoC challenges with it.

## Repo link
2024 solutions are available on my [aoc repository](https://github.com/insomnes/aoc/tree/main/2024)

## 01 Historian Hysteria
