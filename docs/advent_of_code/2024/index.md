# Advent of Code 2024
In this year we are looking for lost Chief Historian elf.

And I've decided to refresh my Go skills by solving AoC challenges with it.

## Repo link
2024 solutions are available on my [aoc repository](https://github.com/insomnes/aoc/tree/main/2024)

## 01 Historian Hysteria
[AoC day page](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1)

[Warm up day](01_history.md). Find difference between sorted values of two lists.

## 02 Red-Nosed Reports
[AoC day page](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2)

[Check the unusual data](02_reports.md). Find the "unsafe" levels in reports by provided rules.
