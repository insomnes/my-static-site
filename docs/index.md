Welcome to Mikhail Dengin's personal website.
This site is a collection of blog posts, personal projects and other things I find interesting.

## About me
I am a software enthusiast with a passion for programming and technology.
I am currently working as an MLOps Engineer at [Semrush](https://www.semrush.com/).
I am interested in DevOps and software development principles in general.
My goto programming language is Python, but I also enjoy writing in Rust and Go.
